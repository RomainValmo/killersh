create a file at path `/opt/secret/value.txt` with the value of `secret`. You have get this value with kubectl command.

Try to get this secret directly from ETCD. 

You have to use etcdctl. 

Tips. secrets are stored by default in ETCD DB in this path `regitry/secrets/namespace/nameofsecret`

Copy all the answer from ETCD DB to `/opt/secret/valueetcd.txt`
